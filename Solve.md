# Problem
<code>$  sudo chmod u+x run.sh </code>  
<code>$  sudo chmod 777 run.sh</code>  
Although these two command lines let me get the highest authority of "run.sh";  
However,because there is no modification of the nature "Allow file as a program"  
 of the document "Velodyne_viewer";  
So I always run the run.sh file is always prompted to "Permission denied"!  

<pre>Correct the code only need to TA according to the above data on the PPT on it</pre>
