## Measurement scheme on LiDAR(VLP16/HDL-32E)'s longest distance  
The HDL-32E creates 360° 3D images by using 32 laser/detector pairs whose housing rapidly spins to scan the surrounding environment.  
This design allows for the lasers to each fire thousands of times per second, providing a rich, 3D point cloud.  
Digital signal processing and waveform analysis provide high accuracy,extended distance sensing and intensity data.
The HDL-32E uses a direct drive motor system, employing no belts or chains in the drive train, to improve reliability and reduce maintenance.  
The unit provides:
<pre><code>• A 360° horizontal field of view (FOV)
• A 41.3° vertical FOV
• Usable returns up to 70 meters</code></pre>

Radar can be placed in areas where high moderate (allowing in vertical movement).There is a certain distance from the Angle of the measurable vertical Angle for radar is given for + 10.67 ~ -30.67(41.3° vertical FOV).  
Avoid that other Angle measuring distance is different from 0 degrees,we measure all the Angle.  
### Step1:  
Measurement using a small board to ensure that the vertical we send small wooden wearing empty a line, the other end of it pin by radar.

### Step2:
We open the radar after holding a small board back slowly until data acquisition cannot detect small boards. Small board line with small planks always stay vertical Then we can return to furthest distance which can catch the small board.
### Step3:
According to the online, radar distance accuracy < 2 cm, so every time we move the board will be moved to 1 cm or 0.5 mm (can use tape measure,you don't have to every time to go again to test mobile distance), until it is concluded that the longest distance for the horizontal angel.
### Step4:
The angle from the angle of the ground level is the longest distance,and the distance in each direction in the radar sector should be measured again to reduce the error.
